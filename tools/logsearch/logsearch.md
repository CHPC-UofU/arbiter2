# Arbiter2 Log Search
This is a tool for administrators to view logs generated by Arbiter2 using a web interface. It is not required for the main program to run.

## Installation
The Log Search program has the same dependencies as Arbiter2 but also requires the Flask microframework.

## Usage
Run the logsearch.py program with Flask.

```bash
export FLASK_APP=logsearch.py
python3 -m flask run
```
